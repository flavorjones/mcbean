== HEAD

Features:

* McBean.markdown now sensibly returns a McBean instance, instead of a Markdownify::Antidote instance.
* McBean#to_html now does the right thing when the instance is created via McBean.markdown.
* McBean#to_html now entity-escapes unsafe and invalid HTML tags (thanks to Loofah).

Deprecations:

* McBean.new and .allocate are now private. Use one of the constructors: .fragment, .document or .markdown.
* McBean#html and #markdown accessors have been dropped.
